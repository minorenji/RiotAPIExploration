# RiotAPIExploration
Project I made to experiment with RiotAPI and Python in general. As of now, it doesn't do anything too special, it just fetches user data through the API for the game League of Legends. It parses out the relevant data and records a certain number of played matches into a file. 

This is an update to [this](https://github.com/minorenji/LeagueStats) project from before, designed to be more efficient.
